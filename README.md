## Overview

The Automated Hydroponics Dozer is designed to streamline hydroponic farming by automating nutrient dosing based on real-time pH and TDS sensor readings. This repository contains the Arduino code for microcontroller interfacing, Python scripts for data processing, and a user-friendly interface for farmers to input specifications.

## Features

- **pH and TDS Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of pH and TDS levels in the hydroponic system.
- **Automated Nutrient Dosing:** Solenoid valves control the release of nutrients into the system based on sensor readings.
- **User Interface:** Python-based interface for farmers to input specifications and monitor system status.
- **Customizable:** Easily configurable for different hydroponic setups and crop requirements.

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Python 3.x
- [Arduino Board](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products)
- pH Sensor
- TDS Sensor
- Solenoid Valves
- (List any other hardware and software dependencies)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-hydroponics-dozer.git`
2. Upload the Arduino code (`hydroponics_dozer.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. (Any other installation steps)

## Usage

1. Connect the Arduino board to the sensors and solenoid valves according to the wiring diagram (provide or link to a diagram).
2. Run the Arduino code on the board.
3. Execute the Python script for the user interface: `python interface.py`
4. Follow on-screen instructions to input specifications and monitor the hydroponic system.

## Configuration

- Modify `config.py` to customize system parameters and pins for your specific setup.
